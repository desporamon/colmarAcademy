Code Written for JFSD Web Assessment - Desmond Chua Yew Guan

●	What did you like about this project?
This assessment really test my understanding on the core concepts in HTML and CSS taught in the past few weeks. It helps to reinforce the concepts taught in class. It gives me a sense of accomplishment that I can really write code from scratch given that just a few days ago I was still really not confident and doubting myself. I think the codes written cover all the core concepts in class. I am also very thankful that there are specifications/ template given. When we were given the Colmar assignment for the header and section one initially, I panicked.. though I can get the flex right, I just can't get the formatting of the page right.. After first round of clarification with Jean with the refresher on mediaquery, I can finally get the page to load up correctly on live server with the codes I wrote. 

●	What did you struggle with in this project?
I feel that my HTML structure is very clear. I name every similar element with class clearly so that it will be easier for me to style it. However, I feel that my CSS is very messy. I have to work section-by-section with the live server at the side and there were losts of padding/ margin issues. Even though I could get it to the template style eventually, I feel that there are too many repeated codes in my CSS. Due to time constraint, I'm not able to clean my codes.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Overall, this assessment is very challenging for me. I struggled a lot and spent Tuesday to get the desktop version up. I again stuggled with the formatting with the mobile version and spent another two hours to make sure everything comes out nicely.. However, I am glad to go through this so that I know my weaknesses in my codes.. Perhaps, more comments can be given on how to improve on my codes after reviewing.
